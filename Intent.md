Path management in Unity3D is a pain in the ass for two reasons.


Type of path:
- It is a relative or an absolute path ?

Where to store the information on what platform:
- It is store in Unity Asset or Unity Root
- It is store in perma folder or sdcard folder

I have some code in my main toolbox.
But it means that I have to link to a moving toolboxes.

So this package intent is to have a clean version that developer can use without working about change.
